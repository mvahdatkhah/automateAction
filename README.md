##  What is GitHub Actions?

GitHub Actions is a powerful automation tool that enables you to run tasks (like testing, building, or deploying) automatically when certain events occur in your GitHub repository. Workflows are defined in YAML files and stored in the `.github/workflows` directory.

##  Prerequisites

- A GitHub repository where you want to set up GitHub Actions.
- Write access to the repository.
- Basic understanding of YAML syntax.

##  Setting Up a Workflow

### 1 Creating a Workflow File

To get started, create a workflow file in your repository:

1. Navigate to your repository on GitHub.
2. Create a new directory at the root of your repository called `.github/workflows`.
3. Inside this directory, create a new YAML file, for example `ci.yml`.

### 2 Choosing an Event Trigger

Event triggers specify when your workflow should run. Common triggers include:

- `push`: Run the workflow when code is pushed to the repository.
- `pull_request`: Run the workflow for pull requests.
- `schedule`: Run the workflow on a defined schedule (e.g., daily, weekly).
- `workflow_dispatch`: Manually trigger the workflow.

You can define the trigger in your YAML file under the `on` keyword. For example:

```yaml
on: push

3 Defining Jobs and Steps

Workflows consist of jobs, and jobs consist of steps. A job runs on a specific runner (e.g., Ubuntu, Windows) and can execute various steps like running commands or scripts.

Example structure:

yaml

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v3

      - name: Set up Node.js
        uses: actions/setup-node@v3
        with:
          node-version: '16'

      - name: Install dependencies
        run: npm install

      - name: Run tests
        run: npm test

 Sample Workflow

Heres a full example of a basic CI workflow for a Node.js project:

yaml

name: CI

on: [push, pull_request]

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v3

      - name: Set up Node.js
        uses: actions/setup-node@v3
        with:
          node-version: '16'

      - name: Install dependencies
        run: npm install

      - name: Run tests
        run: npm test

This workflow runs when code is pushed to the repository or when a pull request is created. It checks out the code, sets up Node.js, installs dependencies, and runs tests.
